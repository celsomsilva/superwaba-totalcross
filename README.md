# superwaba-totalcross
## Project developed in 2005

SuperWaba evolved from the Waba project which was an independent forerunner of Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME). SuperWaba had initial support only for Palm OS; starting in version 3, it added support for Windows CE, as the prior Waba VM.

Since the 5.0 release, SuperWaba has used the SDL library for driving the display, which increases its portability to many other platforms.

The support for SuperWaba has ceased and its successor, TotalCross,[2] is the primary mobile SDK. Totalcross Beta 4 was released on January 12, 2009. TotalCross, a superior solution to SuperWaba, offers greater platform stability, leaner compilation of Java code, and added ability in a smaller footprint.
